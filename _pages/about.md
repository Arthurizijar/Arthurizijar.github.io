I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Beihang University, supervised by Prof. [Richong Zhang](https://zhangrichong.github.io/) and [Yongyi Mao](https://www.eecs.uottawa.ca/~yymao/) (uOttawa). I finished my undergraduate studies at Beihang University and transitioned into the Ph.D. program in 2021.

I am visiting Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), supervised by Prof. [Qiang Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/qsun) (Uoft).

I have a broad interest in natural language processing, especially for **text representation learning**.
