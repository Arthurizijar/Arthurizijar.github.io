I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Beihang University, supervised by Professors Richong Zhang, Yongyi Mao, and Xudong Liu. I began his undergraduate studies at Beihang University in 2017 and transitioned into the Ph.D. program in 2021.

I am visiting MBZUAI in the UAE, collaborating with Professor Qiang Sun.

I  have a broad interest in natural language processing, especially for **text representation learning**.
