I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Shenyuan Honors Collage, Beihang University, supervised by Professors [Richong Zhang](https://zhangrichong.github.io/) and [Yongyi Mao](https://www.eecs.uottawa.ca/~yymao/) (uOttawa). I began my undergraduate studies at Beihang University in 2017 and transitioned into the Ph.D. program in 2021.

I am visiting MBZUAI in the UAE, collaborating with Prof. [Qiang Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/qsun) (Uoft).

I  have a broad interest in natural language processing, especially for **text representation learning**.
