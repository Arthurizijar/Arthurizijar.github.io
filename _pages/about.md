## üë®‚ÄçüéìAbout Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Prof. [Richong Zhang](https://zhangrichong.github.io/) and [Yongyi Mao](https://www.eecs.uottawa.ca/~yymao/) (uOttawa). I finished my undergraduate studies at Beihang University and transitioned into the Ph.D. program in 2021.

I visited [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) from 2024.09 to 2025.08, under the guidance of Prof. [Qiang Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/qsun) (Uoft). I am currently interning at [Qwen Lab](https://qwenlm.github.io/) in Beijing.

I have a broad interest in **Natural Language Processing** and **Information Retrieval**.
